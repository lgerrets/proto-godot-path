# TODOs

## Features

## Future ideas
- some enemies avoid other enemies ? (how? implement a second astar whose coefs are dynamic)
- some enemies are heavier
- player is heavier when idle ? player's mass may be a gameplay thing (some stuff gives more mass)

## Bugs
- in e3fc7ab49aeb34d3b4ef7b84ba72e67048fa28c4: sometimes following paths is bugged eg entity does not make progress or wiggles
- in e3fc7ab49aeb34d3b4ef7b84ba72e67048fa28c4: `assert(len(path) > 0)`
